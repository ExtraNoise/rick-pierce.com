			<p>
				I love interfaces. Web interfaces, game interfaces, app interfaces. The only thing I like more than interacting with a good interface is <em>designing</em> a good interface.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my professional career has been spent working directly with user experience, whether it be developing interactions in a design or creating the design itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe in a tactile experience, even when a user is experiencing a design through a screen. My goal is to help the user help themselves and&mdash;after they're done using the product&mdash;forget the interface was ever there.

				I've been developing websites and pages in one form or another for over fifteen years. I am a methodical and thoughtful developer, always striving for code so clean and readable that non-developers could understand it. I'm not satisfied with a block of code until it meets my expectations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently I've focused my talents on email development, which requires a strict and precise level of coding to display properly across all browsers and email clients. Factor into that mobile rendering and animation, and it's no surprise that I've overseen email development for some of the largest brands on planet.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've always loved a good challenge.

				Graphic design is where I began my professional career. As such, I have a soft-spot for both digital and print design and regularly like to create new work that honors the strengths of both of these realms.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a developer, these talents come into good use when working on projects that might not have a specific graphic designer or when the graphic design department is already on another assignment.
			</p>

				I primarily work in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, but I am comfortable with other (older) applications such as Quark and Corel tools.

			<p>Outside of design, more "traditional" art and alternative works are usually used in supplementation to a project I'm developing. In many cases I simply like to express some creativity without it being attached to a specific job. The following section has various forms of other art I've done from game assets to personal projects in traditional medium to large-scale marketing campaigns.</p>
			<p>I enjoy working in a wide range mediums, from digital illustration or pixel art. Photography (HDR and stereo) and photo-manipulation are also hobbies of mine.</p>
			<p>You'll also notice a selection of my 3D work, both for real-time applications and high-poly models. I found that when I played games, I enjoyed modifying them more than playing them and eventually took up 3D art as a way of bringing my ideas to life.</p>

			<a class="thumb" data-lightbox="illustration" data-title="<strong>Battalion Command development</strong><br><br>In 2016 a friend and I stumbled upon tabletop wargaming and were instantly hooked. We’ve since recruited a small group from our office that does weekly games in the evening after work. I especially enjoyed the “complicated” rule sets—the kind usually only found in video games—expressed in a tangible way. It’s a lot of fun to take an active role in generating the numbers the game uses to determine outcomes by rolling dice.<br><br>With an assortment of tabletop rules in mind, I began working on a ruleset for my own tabletop game called Battalion Command. The game pits two or more players in direct competition (or teams in competition) to eliminate each other or fulfill objectives, depending on the scenario chosen by the players before the game begins.<br><br>Players take control of a group of tanks (usually from 3 to 15) and give orders to the crew inside each tank (as outlined on a large playing card kept to the side of the board) to position those tanks, fire upon their opponents, and carry out special abilities. Crewmen inside may not always respond to a command ordered, may panic, and occasionally will perish or rout during battle.<br><br>In addition to modeling the individual crew operating each tank, the tanks themselves have unique attributes that can be activated. The weapon systems are also modeled, so that certain types of rounds can be loaded and used to destroy especially difficult opponents or “spot” tanks for aerial and artillery strikes. Right now the game focuses on the armored vehicles used during World War II and the early Cold War, but the goal is to incorporate the breadth of armored history, from the Great War to today.<br><br><strong>Created:</strong> 2018" href="images/major_bc.jpg"><img src="images/thumb_bc.jpg" /></a>
